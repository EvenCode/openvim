# OpenVim
Interactive tutorial for Vim.

== What is OpenVim? ==

OpenVim is a web-based project to let people quickly have a taste what kind of an editor Vim is.
Motivation comes from the fact that Vim is very useful but the learning curve is devastating.

OpenVim is based on a custom engine that interprets vim commands. 
Fun fact: the engine operates directly on the dom but can be easily refactored to a model that is not view-dependent.

== How to help? ==

**If you want to help with actual code, look at the issues contributed by users. Especially keybindings are hard for me to get right in different environments.**

== Development ==
